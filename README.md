# ðŸš€ CodeAlpha Python Internship Projects

This repository contains *three Python miniâ€‘projects* that I completed as part of the *CodeAlpha Python Internship*.  
Each project is designed to practice core Python concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, data structures, and input/output handling.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

ðŸ”¹ *Hangman Game*  
A simple textâ€‘based word guessing game.  
The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player has 6 chances to guess the word by entering one letter at a time.  
*Key Concepts:* random, while loop, if-else, lists, strings

---

ðŸ”¹ *Stock Portfolio Tracker*  
A consoleâ€‘based application that calculates the total investment value.  
The program uses a hardcoded dictionary of stock prices, takes user input for stock names and quantities, and outputs the total cost.  
*Key Concepts:* dictionary, loops, input/output, basic arithmetic

---

ðŸ”¹ *Basic Chatbot*  
A ruleâ€‘based chatbot that responds to simple user inputs like *hello, **how are you, and **bye*.  
It uses conditional statements inside a loop to interact with the user until they exit.  
*Key Concepts:* if-elif, loops, functions, input/output

## âœ¨ Skills Practiced
âœ” Loops (while, for)  
âœ” Conditional logic (if-elif-else)  
âœ” Data structures (lists, dictionaries)  
âœ” Functions and input/output handling  
âœ” Problemâ€‘solving through small, realâ€‘life inspired programs
